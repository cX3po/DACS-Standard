# Security Policy

DACS is a draft standard under active development, validated against the
[Demos Network](https://demos.sh). We take security reports seriously and
welcome coordinated disclosure from implementers and reviewers.

## Reporting a vulnerability — do NOT open a public issue

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in the DACS specification,
a reference implementation, or the substrate primitives DACS depends on, **please
report it privately**. Publicly filing an exploitable issue exposes an attack
surface before it can be fixed.

Use either channel:

1. **GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting** — the *Security* tab → *Report a
   vulnerability* (enable "Private vulnerability reporting" in repo settings if not
   already on). This keeps the report private until a fix ships.
2. **A dedicated security contact** — a monitored address (e.g. `security@kynesys…`)
   listed here by the steward.

A high-signal report names: the **affected component** (spec §, file path, or
contract), the **impact** (what an attacker gains), a **minimal reproduction / PoC**
where possible, and a **suggested fix direction**.

## Scope

In scope: spec rules with security impact (signature/replay/atomicity/authorization
defects), the reference implementations, and the substrate primitives (SR-1…SR-5) as
they back conformant DACS flows — including bridge/settlement custody, L2PS channel
confidentiality/soundness, consensus/validator enforcement, and key handling.

## Coordinated disclosure

We ask reporters to give the steward reasonable time to ship a fix before any public
write-up, and we will credit reporters who wish to be named. For pre-mainnet issues,
the goal is to fix quietly and disclose together once patched.

## Signed advisories (optional)

Reporters MAY attach a **signed advisory** — an attestation binding the report to a
keypair (e.g. the DACS-5 envelope-receipt format) so the steward can verify the
report's integrity and provenance. This is optional but encouraged for high-severity
findings; it dogfoods the same verification discipline DACS specifies.
